### Bash sucks
While good for simple programs where latency or performance isn't important, there are real costs to running a bash script every time you open a terminal. Use something written in an actual development language instead.

### Configurability is nice
In most Screenfetch-like programs, you have fairly limited control over what inforamtion gets displayed. Not so with slash. You are given a configuration file dictating the information and format, so now you can customize to your heart's content.

### Installation
[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/47d01a744a144664b8abeff7a9592fd5)](https://www.codacy.com/app/ben_mon/slash?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=Nyctanthous/slash&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

`slash` is still under development. At this time, you should clone the repository and run `make`. `lspci` is expected for finding out GPU information.

### Thanks
Bash or no, the programming behind [screenfetch][1] and [neofetch][2] has proven a valuable resource when looking for a place to get started. Thanks for the idea and for providing these useful tools to the community.
