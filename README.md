### Bash sucks
While good for simple programs where latency or performance isn't important, there are real costs to running a bash script every time you open a terminal. Use something written in an actual development language instead.

### Configurability is nice
In most Screenfetch-like programs, you have fairly limited control over what inforamtion gets displayed. Not so with slash. You are given a configuration file dictating the information and format, so now you can customize to your heart's content.

### Thanks
Bash or no, the programming behind [screenfetch][1] and [neofetch][2] has proven a valuable resource when looking for a place to get started. Thanks for the idea and for providing these useful tools to the community.
